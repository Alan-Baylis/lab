## ![lab logo](https://github.com/marekdaniluk/lab/blob/master/Assets/lab/Icons/32x32/lab.png) What is lab?
Lab stands for lightweight ai behaviour. It is a small Unity 3D plugin that provides tools for creating and using behavioral trees to your projects. What is unique for lab, is that it separates logic from implementation.

That means, lab is not out-of-the-box-ready-to-use framework. If you need a tool for rapid prototype there are other tools that give you predefined tasks or integrate with other popular Unity’s plugins. Lab tries to act like one of Unity’s internal modules, when you see lab’s editor, you will see it is inspired by Unity’s new animation system.
